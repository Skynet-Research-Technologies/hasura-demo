# GraphQL Client Architecture

This document explains the architecture and design decisions of the `@hasura-demo/graphql-client` package.

## Overview

The GraphQL client provides a typed interface to interact with the Hasura DDN GraphQL server. It was designed to:

1. Provide a simple, consistent API for common operations
2. Support advanced features like custom field selection and filtering
3. Handle authentication seamlessly
4. Include debugging and monitoring features
5. Be testable via end-to-end tests

## Key Components

### Core Client (`index.js`)

The main client class that handles:
- GraphQL request/response handling
- Authentication
- Request history tracking
- Query and mutation methods for each entity

### Configuration (`config.js`)

Centralized configuration management that:
- Loads environment variables
- Provides defaults
- Separates test and production configurations

### Module Exports (`exports.js`)

Exports multiple ways to use the client:
- Default export: The client class
- Named exports: Factory functions for common use cases
- Configuration object

### TypeScript Declarations (`index.d.ts`)

Type definitions for:
- Client class and methods
- Configuration options
- Request/response interfaces

## Data Flow

1. Client instantiation:
   - Load configuration
   - Set up authentication headers
   - Create GraphQL client

2. Query execution:
   - Parse query options (fields, filters, etc.)
   - Build GraphQL query
   - Execute and track request
   - Return response

3. Mutation execution:
   - Parse mutation options and objects
   - Build GraphQL mutation
   - Execute and track request
   - Return response with affected rows and returning data

## Testing Strategy

The tests are designed as end-to-end tests that:
1. Create data with insert mutations
2. Query the created data
3. Update the data
4. Verify the updates
5. Delete the data
6. Verify deletion

This provides complete coverage of the client's functionality and ensures it works correctly with the actual GraphQL API.

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to consider:
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
- Request batching for multiple queries
- Subscription support
- Caching layer
- Rate limiting protection
- More comprehensive error handling and validation
